Clinical Scenario Repository
============================

The Clinical Scenario Repository <sup>©</sup>, CSR <sup>©</sup>, Good Ideas for Patient Safety <sup>©</sup> or GIPS <sup>©</sup> is a web tool that will allow clinicians, clinical engineers and other professionals to document and share technological barriers, near misses and other clinical events that pose a threat to patient safety as well as potential solutions for these threats and simple good ideas to improve patient safety.

The Clinical Scenario Repository was devised by the [Medical Device 'Plug and Play' Program][1] to address the forementioned needs. [A working version of this prototype][5] is hosted by courtesy of the MD PnP program.

You can use the [repository's issue][3] tracker for reporting bugs, problems, ideas, discussions, etc. or you can participate via the [OpenICE community platform][4].



TECHNOLOGY STACK
----------------

This current implementation of the Clinical Scenario Repository has been developed using the [Meteor platform][2] (v1.2). Thus, it is a JavaScript based app, which uses MongoDB as a database. These technologies were chosen to allow rapid prototyping and flexibility for changes as this idea matures.
