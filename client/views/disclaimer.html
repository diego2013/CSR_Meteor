    <p>Although all scenarios submitted to this repository are revised by a group of administrators and clinical and non-clinical reviewers, this revision process does not occur on an immediate nor timely manner.

    <p>Although we appreciate all collaborations, depending on the implications of the hazard discovered or nature of the event to 
     be reported, users may want to or may be legally obliged to report them to the appropriate 
     organisms through the established channels.
